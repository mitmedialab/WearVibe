# WearVibe: Improving Attention via Haptic Rhythmic Stimuli

Click [here](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/programming-body-rhythms/overview/) for the full project page.

This repository contains the source code for the WearVibe smartwatch app, which presents the rhythmic vibration pulses similar to the ones in the paper: [Improving Attention Using Wearables via Haptic and Multimodal Rhythmic Stimuli](https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642256) by Nathan W Whitmore*, Samantha Chan*, Jingru Zhang, Patrick Chwalek, Sam Chin, and Pattie Maes.

You can set your desired frequency of vibration pulses from the smartwatch using the slider (e.g., setting to 40 Hz will deliver 10 millisecond pulses of vibration at 40 pulses per second) and click Vibe to start the vibrations.

## Getting Started
We recommend cloning the repo and using "Import Project" in Android Studio to build this project.
